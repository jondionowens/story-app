He wore a bespoke looking three piece suit made of fine wool with a red satin handkerchief that bloomed from the pocket on his chest. He looked expensive, like most of the money in his bank account had been there longer that he’d been alive. His hands laid clasped in his lap, and Tom could make out the brand of his wristwatch—a Patek Philippe probably worth as much as a very nice family sedan.
